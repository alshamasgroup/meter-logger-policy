<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 26 November 2025</p>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>Electricity Meter Logger</strong>
    (\"the App\") handles your information. The App is developed and published by
    <strong>AL SHAMAS TECH</strong> (\"we\", \"us\", or \"our\").
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Electricity Meter Logger is designed as an <strong>offline-first personal utility app</strong>
    that helps you record and analyze your household electricity meter readings and bills.
    All core data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not operate any
    backend server and we do not automatically collect or upload your personal data to our servers.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
    The App itself does <strong>not collect, transmit, or sell</strong> any personally
    identifiable information to us or to any third party. All information listed below
    is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and is under your full control:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Meter names and reference/billing numbers you enter.</li>
    <li>Meter readings (dates, units consumed, etc.).</li>
    <li>Billing cycle information and settings, such as billing date and usage limits.</li>
    <li>Per-unit price configuration for expected bill calculations.</li>
    <li>Local backup files you create using the backup feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you choose to manually share backup files (for example via email, cloud storage,
    or messaging apps), that sharing is <strong>initiated by you</strong>, and is outside
    of our control.
</p>

<h2>Permissions Used</h2>
<p>The App may request the following Android permissions, depending on your device and usage:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>INTERNET</strong> and <strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</strong><br />
        Used to:
        <ul>
            <li>Open and display your official electricity bill website inside the app or browser.</li>
            <li>Open external links such as WhatsApp chat or our Facebook page when you tap them.</li>
        </ul>
        The App does <strong>not</strong> send your meter readings or personal data to our servers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Camera (if enabled)</strong><br />
        Used only when you explicitly choose camera-related features
        (for example, capturing meter readings using the camera / OCR).
        Images are processed locally on your device and are not automatically uploaded to any server by us.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Storage / Photos &amp; media (via system file picker)</strong><br />
        Used when:
        <ul>
            <li>You create a local backup of your data to device storage.</li>
            <li>You restore data from a backup file that <strong>you</strong> select.</li>
        </ul>
        Access is typically granted through the Android system picker (SAF). The App only reads or writes the
        specific file you choose and does not scan or access other files on your device.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
    All information you enter is used only to provide core functionality of the App, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Calculating and displaying your electricity usage and expected bill.</li>
    <li>Showing graphs and statistics based on your readings.</li>
    <li>Opening your bill URL with your reference number, as configured in Settings.</li>
    <li>Creating and restoring local backup files at your request.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> use your information for advertising, analytics, or user profiling.
</p>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>
    All meter data and settings are stored locally in an internal database on your device.
    If you choose to create backups, they are stored either in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>App-specific storage; or</li>
    <li>A folder on your device storage that you select/allow.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You are responsible for keeping your device and backup files secure (for example, using
    device screen lock or not sharing backups with untrusted parties).
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
    The App may open third-party websites or apps, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your official electricity supplier bill portal (e.g., PITC DISCO bill pages).</li>
    <li>WhatsApp, when you tap on the “Contact” / WhatsApp button.</li>
    <li>Facebook, when you open our official Facebook page.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These services are governed by their own privacy policies. We recommend that you review
    their policies directly.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
    The App is intended for general use by adults managing household utilities and is not
    specifically directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data
    from children.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<p>
    All data is stored locally on your device and is retained as long as the App remains
    installed or until you delete the App data or backup files. To remove your data, you can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clear the App’s data from Android system settings; and/or</li>
    <li>Uninstall the App; and/or</li>
    <li>Manually delete any backup files you have created.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    or legal requirements. Any changes will be updated in this screen and may also be
    reflected on the Google Play listing.
